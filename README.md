# 🧠 YOLO Image Detection Project

This repository contains a computer vision project that uses the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection algorithm to detect and classify objects in images. The implementation is done in a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates how to apply pretrained YOLO models to perform real-time and static image detection.

## 📁 Files in the Repository

- `Yolo Image detection.ipynb`: The core notebook where YOLO is applied to detect objects in given images. Includes:
  - Loading YOLOv3/YOLOv5 weights or using OpenCV/Darknet-based models
  - Performing inference on custom images
  - Displaying bounding boxes and labels on detected objects
